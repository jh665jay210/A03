<h2>PART 2: GITHUB TERMS</h2>
  <li><b>Branch</b>: A copy version of a repository that does not affect the master branch and allows you to code freely without disrupting your original version.
  
  <li><b>Clone</b>: A copy of a repository that resides in your computer rather than online.

  <li><b>Commit</b>: It is a change to a file or multiple files, that includes a brief description of what the changes to the files were made.
 
<li><b>Fetch</b>: Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.
<li><b>GIT</b>: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.
  
<li><b>Github</b>: It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
  
  <li><b>Merge</b>: Takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. I can be done automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface.
  
  <li><b>Merge Conflict</b>: This happens when a person makes different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.
    
    
  <li><b>Push</b>: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.

  <li><b>Pull</b>: When you are fetching changes and merging them.

  <li><b>Remote</b>: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
  
  <li><b>Repository</b>: A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
